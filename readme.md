# Linode Kubernetes Engine homework assignments

Thanks for joining our live labs!

Homework assignments are listed below, and the aim is to have fun learning and to do as much as possible with as little help from Google as possible. 

# Week 1

This week's lab focussed on building an LKE cluster, configuring kubectl, and deploying an app. I reckon you should be able to complete step 1 without any help, but I also reckon you'll need a bunch of help for steps 3 and 4 (I know I would).

1. Build an LKE cluster with a single node pool comprising two nodes
2. Install `kubectl` on your laptop/desktop
3. Configure `kubectl` to talk to your new LKE cluster
4. Deploy the [`nigelpoulton/lke-nodebalancer:1.0`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nigelpoulton/lke-nodebalancer) application using a Deployment YAML file
5. **Remember to delete your cluster when you're finished.** Failure to do this will incur costs.

Happy learning, and feel free to ping me publicly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nigelpoulton) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigelpoulton/) with how get on, and feel free to copy @Linode.
